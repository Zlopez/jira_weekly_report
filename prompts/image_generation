# screenshot-to-code

You are tasked with converting a screenshot into an image template for generating similar images using Pillow. Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Analyze the screenshot:
   Review the provided screenshot carefully. Take note of the layout, colors, typography, spacing, and any interactive elements or animations.

2. Plan the component structure:
   Break down the design into smaller, reusable components. Identify the main container and its child components. Consider how the layout will respond to different screen sizes.

3. Implement the basic layout:
   Start by creating the main component and its structure using Pillow. Implement the component hierarchy you planned in step 2.

4. Style:
   Match the design in the screenshot. Pay attention to:

   - Layout and positioning
   - Colors and gradients
   - Typography (font sizes, weights, and styles)
   - Spacing and padding

8. Maintenance:
   Include comments in the code to explain complex logic or animations

Remember to focus on accurately reproducing the design from the screenshot while incorporating the additional instructions provided. Use your expertise in Pillow to create a high-quality and visually accurate implementation.
